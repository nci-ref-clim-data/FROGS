## Overview

The Frequent Rainfall Observations on GridS (FROGS) database
is a collection of daily precipitation products on a common 1×1 deg grid.
The collection includes satellite, ground-based and reanalysis products.
Most of the satellite products were calibrated using rain gauges data,
for these, where available, the non adjusted version is also provided.
The temporal range included starts from 1901 to 2019 depending on the data product.
Where it is possible the database will be extended in future updates of FROGs.
The data products spatial coverage is also dependent on the original sources.

For more information please refer to the [FROGs website](https://frogs.prod.lamp.cnrs.fr/)
and in particular to their news page for updates.

## Data download

The data is downloaded from the [IPSL ftp site](https://ftp.climserv.ipsl.polytechnique.fr/FROGs/1DD_V1/), using the frogs.py python code available in this repository.
Updates of the original data are sporadic, we check if any update is available with monthly frequency. Tha automated updates are managed via the [Jenkins accessdev server](https://accessdev.nci.org.au/jenkins/job/aus-ref-clim-data-nci/job/FROGs/).
